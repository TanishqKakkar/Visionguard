🛡️ Intelligent CCTV Surveillance System Using Deep Learning

An AI-powered smart surveillance system for real-time human activity recognition and anomaly detection from CCTV video streams.
This project evaluates and deploys state-of-the-art hybrid deep learning architectures to balance accuracy, temporal intelligence, and real-world performance for smart-city security applications.

📌 Project Overview

Traditional CCTV surveillance relies heavily on manual monitoring, leading to delayed responses, human fatigue, and inconsistent threat detection.
This project addresses these limitations by introducing an automated, intelligent video surveillance pipeline capable of understanding spatio-temporal human behavior using deep learning.

The system processes CCTV footage as 16-frame video sequences, extracts spatial features, models temporal motion, and classifies activities in real time.
